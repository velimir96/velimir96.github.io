<br>I am a second year <b>PhD student</b> in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Krsti%C4%87">Prof. Miroslav Krstic</a>.
I am working on <b>model-free optimization</b> and <b>safe stabilization</b> for dynamical systems with applications ranging from steering mobile robots in GPS-denied environments to seeking of Nash equilibria.
More recently, I am developing novel <em>control degins</em> for <b>parking</b> (stabilization) of nonholonomic vehicles, that are simultaneously <b>safe, optimal, and adaptive </b>, as well as park the vehicles in <em>used-defined finite time</em>. <br><br>


<br>
I have obtained a M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the  <a href="https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-electrical-engineering-information-technology/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> where I focused on <b>Automation and Robotics</b>.
I have also spent a year as a research assistant at the  <a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/itr/startseite/">Chair of Information-oriented Control at TUM</a>. 
Before that, I did my undergrad in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.eei.tf.fau.de/">FAU</a> where my bachelor thesis on algorithms for fault diagnosis in dynamical systems was advised by <a href="https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/mrm/institut/mitarbeitende/institutsleitung/prof-dr-ing-habil-joachim-deutscher/"> Prof. Joachim Deutscher</a>.
