I am a second-year PhD student in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego (UCSD)</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Krsti%C4%87">Prof. Miroslav Krstić</a>.
I work on <b>model-free optimization</b> and <b>safe stabilization</b> for dynamical systems, with applications ranging from mobile robot navigation in GPS-denied environments to seeking Nash equilibria.
More recently, I have been developing novel control designs for <b>parking of nonholonomic vehicles</b> that are simultaneously safe, optimal, and adaptive, and guarantee convergence in user-defined finite time.
<br><br>

I also spent a year as a <b>Research Assistant</b> at the <a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home/">Chair of Information-Oriented Control</a> at TUM.
I hold an <b>M.Sc.</b> in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-electrical-engineering-information-technology/">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a>, where I specialized in Automation and Robotics.
Before that, I completed my <b>B.Sc.</b> in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://www.eei.tf.fau.de/">FAU</a>, where my bachelor’s thesis on fault-diagnosis algorithms was supervised by <a href="https://www.uni-ulm.de/in/mrm/institut/mitarbeitende/institutsleitung/prof-dr-ing-habil-joachim-deutscher/">Prof. Joachim Deutscher</a>.
