I am a second-year PhD student in <b>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</b> at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego (UCSD)</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Krsti%C4%87">Prof. Miroslav Krstić</a>.
I work on <b>model-free optimization</b> and <b>safe stabilization</b> for dynamical systems, with applications ranging from mobile robot navigation in GPS-denied environments to seeking Nash equilibria.
More recently, I have been developing novel control <em>feedback</em> designs for <b>parking of nonholonomic vehicles</b> that are simultaneously <em>safe</em>, <em>optimal</em>, <em>adaptive</em>, and guarantee convergence in user-defined <em>finite time</em>.
<br><br>

I also spent a year as a <b>Research Assistant</b> at the <a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/itr/home/">Chair of Information-Oriented Control</a> at <a href="https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-electrical-engineering-information-technology/">Technical University of Munich</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hirche-sandra">Prof. Sandra Hirche</a>.
I hold an <b>M.Sc.</b> in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/studies/degree-programs/master-electrical-engineering-information-technology/">Technical University of Munich</a>, where I specialized in <b>Automation and Robotics</b>.
Before that, I completed my <b>B.Sc.</b> in Electrical Engineering at the <a href="https://www.eei.tf.fau.de/">University of Erlangen-Nuremberg</a>, where my bachelor’s thesis on fault-diagnosis algorithms was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WnTEq3QAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Joachim Deutscher</a>.
