<br>I am a second year <b>PhD student</b> in Mechanical and Aerospace engineering at <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">UCSD</a> 
where I am advised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miroslav_Krsti%C4%87">Prof. Miroslav Krstic</a>.
I work towards <em>creating</em> novel <em>methodologies</em> for <b>data-driven forecasting 
and decision-making with performance guarantees</b>. 
Developing such algorithms is of high relevance in data-driven modeling, 
learning control and AI for science, with applications in <strong>system 
identification, optimal control, simulation and uncertainty quantification</strong>.<br><br>

<br>
Together with the research team at 
<a href="https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/itr/startseite/">TUM-ITR</a> and 
in collaboration with partners across Europe, 
I helped develop strategies for the automated collection of underwater litter as part of the <a href="https://seaclear-project.eu/">SeaClear</a> project. 
In particular, my work with the team related to <b>robotic software development</b>, <b>motion planning</b>, as well as <b>real-time control and estimation</b>.
